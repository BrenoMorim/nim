## About the project

> CS50AI exercise link: <https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/4/nim/>

The play.py file and the signature of the functions of the nim.py file were already created by the CS50AI staff, so my task as a student was to create an AI capable of playing the Nim game. Using the method of reinforcement learning, making the AI play against itself 10000 times.

## Rules of the game

In the Nim game, you have 4 piles with sticks:

- Pile 0: 1 stick
- Pile 1: 3 sticks
- Pile 2: 5 sticks
- Pile 3: 7 sticks

The two players have to remove a certain number of sticks from one pile every turn, the player to remove the last stick will be the loser.

## Try it yourself

To run the game yourself, just run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BrenoMorim/nim.git nim
cd nim
python play.py
```
